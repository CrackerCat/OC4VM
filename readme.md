# PROJECT ABANDONED
It is unfortunate that the phasing out of Intel macOS and Broadcom/VMware's support for macOS guests has led
me to abandon the work. Nothing I do with OpenCore, VMware or QEMU is stable, even on macOS hosts, and this 
will make the project a support nightmare. 

Based on my extensive testing and over 2 years work the situation has become progressively worse. This
is nothing to do with OpenCore which is a fanatastic project and everything to do with the underlying 
support for virtualizing Intel base macOS.
